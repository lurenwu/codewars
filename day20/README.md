Examples:

"din" => "((("

"recede" => "()()()"

"Success" => ")())())"

"(( @" => "))(("


Notes:

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is actually the expected result, not the input! (these languages are locked so that's not possible to correct it).
