Welcome to yet another kata on palindromes!

Your job is to return a string.

The first half of the string should contain valid JavaScript code.

When we receive your string, we will sum up the char codes of each character.

The first half of your string will hopefully represent a function expression, because we

will attempt to call it, passing in the sum as the input.

If the output of the function is the same as the sum, then you pass the kata.

The string must also be a palindrome in order for you to pass.
